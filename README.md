## How it Works? 


Kompass is a modern web application built using powerful web technologies, designed to provide a seamless social and study experience to students. Here's a breakdown of how the platform operates:

Live Study Rooms:

Kompass allows students to create or join real-time virtual study rooms where they can collaborate with peers via integrated chat and video conferencing tools.

Digital Library:

The digital library acts as a resource center where users can access and share study materials such as notes, e-books, and links to useful academic resources.

Social Feed:

The social feed keeps users updated with posts from peers, study tips, group announcements, and more, encouraging interaction and knowledge sharing.

Each student has a personalized profile showcasing their academic interests, study groups, and shared resources.
